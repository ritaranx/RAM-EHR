    "pubmed_def": "Dear Editor, The chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 11) has been now finalized  Reporting of health statistics by Member States to the World Health Organization (WHO) using the new diagnostic system will begin in 2022  The section on mood disorders of the ICD 11 is overall consistent with the corresponding section of the ICD 10  However, the definitions of a depressive and a manic episode have been slightly changed, making them consistent with the DSM 5 (see below), and an independent category of bipolar II disorder has been introduced  A significant effort has been made by the WHO and the American Psychiatric Association to harmonize the diagnostic systems they produce (the ICD 11 and the DSM 5)  Indeed, the organizational framework ( metastructure ) is now the same in the two systems  Nonetheless, several intentional differences between the two classifications remain, or have emerged as a consequence of changes made in the DSM  5  Here we briefly summarize the convergences and the divergences between the ICD 11 and the DSM 5 regarding the section on mood disorders (see Table 1)  A major convergence between the two diagnostic systems regards the minimum number of symptoms required for the diagnosis of major depression ( depressive episode  in the ICD 11)  In the ICD 11, contrary to the ICD 10, the threshold for the diagnosis of depression is the same as in the DSM  at least five depressive symptoms  However, the ICD 11 requires at least five symptoms out of a list of ten (instead of nine as in the DSM 5)  The additional symptom is  hopelessness , which has been found to outperform more than half of DSM symptoms in differentiating depressed from non depressed people (McGlinchey et al  2006)  Table 1  Some Main Differences Between ICD 10, ICD 11 and DSM 5 Concerning the Diagnosis Of Mood Disorders ICD 10 ICD 11 DSM 5 Threshold for diagnosis of depressive episode At least four out of ten symptoms, two of which must be depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, or increased fatigability At least five out of ten symptoms, one of which must be depressed mood or diminished interest or pleasure At least five out of nine symptoms, one of which must be depressed mood or diminished interest or pleasure The threshold for the diagnosis of depression is higher if the person is bereaved Not made explicit Yes No Antidepressant related mania qualifies as a manic episode No Yes Yes Mixed episode is a separate diagnostic entity Yes Yes No Dysthymia is a separate diagnostic entity Yes Yes No Bipolar II disorder is a separate diagnostic entity No Yes Yes  Qualifiers  ( specifiers ) for the diagnoses of mood disorders are provided No Yes Yes CONVERGENCES AND DIVERGENCES IN THE ICD 11 VS  DSM 5 CLASSIFICATION OF MOOD DISORDERS 294 The ICD 11 is also following the DSM 5 in requiring the presence of increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy, in addition to euphoria (or irritability or expansiveness), for the diagnosis of a manic episode, in order to reduce the chance of false positive cases  The two diagnostic systems also converge in considering that a manic or hypomanic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment, and enduring beyond the known physiological effects of that treatment, qualifies as a manic or hypomanic episode  Bipolar II disorder has become an independent category in the ICD 11 (it was just mentioned as an example of  other bipolar affective disorders  in the ICD 10)  Furthermore, for the first time, the ICD follows the DSM in introducing  qualifiers  (corresponding to DSM 5  specifiers ) to the diagnoses of mood disorders, based on specific aspects of symptomatology or course  There are, however, three important aspects in which the two diagnostic systems diverge  All of them are a consequence of changes made in the DSM 5 that the relevant ICD 11 Committee has regarded as not sufficiently supported by the available research evidence  The first of these divergences concerns the issue of bereavement  In the ICD 11, in line with the DSM IV and ICD 10 approach, it is stated that  a depressive episode should not be considered if the depressive symptoms are consistent with the normative response for grieving within the individual's religious and cultural context   However, the diagnosis of depression is not excluded if the person is bereaved  the diagnostic threshold is just raised, exactly as it happens in ordinary clinical practice  A depressive episode during bereavement is suggested by the persistence of symptoms for at least one month, and the presence of at least one symptom which is unlikely to occur in normal grief (such as extreme beliefs of low self worth or guilt not related to the lost loved one, presence of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or psychomotor retardation)  In contrast, the special status conferred by the DSM IV to bereavement among life stressors has been eliminated in the DSM 5  However, two independent follow up studies (Mojtabai 2011, Wakefield and Schmitz 2012) have reported that, in people with baseline bereavement related depression, the risk for the occurrence of a further depressive episode during follow up is significantly lower than in individuals with baseline non bereavement related depression, and not significantly different from the risk of people without a baseline history of depression to develop a first depressive episode during follow up  This research evidence strongly supports the ICD 11 (and DSM IV) approach  Furthermore, an intensive public debate has highlighted the consequences that the DSM 5 approach to the bereavement issue could have in several cultures, including a high rate of false positives and a trivialization of the concept of depression and consequently of mental disorder (Kleinman 2012)  A second divergence between the ICD 11 and DSM 5 sections on mood disorders concerns mixed states  The category of mixed episode is kept in the ICD 11, defined by several prominent manic and depressive symptoms which either occur simultaneously or alternate very rapidly (from day to day or within the same day) during a period of at least two weeks  The mood state is altered throughout the episode (i e , the mood should be depressed, dysphoric, euphoric or expansive for at least two weeks)  When depressive symptoms predominate, common contrapolar symptoms are irritability, racing or crowded thoughts, increased talkativeness, and increased activity  When manic symptoms predominate, common contrapolar symptoms are dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation  This definition is in line with the ICD 10 and completely consistent with both classic and recent research evidence, as well as with clinical experience  In contrast, the DSM 5 solution to eliminate the category of mixed episode and to introduce a specifier  with mixed features , applicable to manic, hypomanic and depressive episodes, has had the consequence to reduce the visibility of  mixity  in ordinary clinical practice (especially since the specifier is not codable, and is therefore at risk of not being recorded in clinical settings)  Moreover, the DSM 5 definition of major depression with mixed features, requiring the presence of at least three  classic  manic symptoms (such as elevated mood, grandiosity, and increased involvement in risky activities) has been criticized for being inconsistent with the concept of mixed depression as delineated in both the classic and recent literature (e g , Koukopoulos and Sani 2014)  A third divergence between the two diagnostic systems consists in the fact that the ICD 11 has not followed the DSM 5 in combining dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive disorder into a single category ( persistent depressive disorder )  In fact, the relevant ICD 11 Committee expert considered that the evidence that the two disorders represent the same condition, to be addressed therapeutically in the same way, is insufficient  The category of dysthymic disorder is kept in the ICD 11, while a qualifier  current episode persistent  is to be used when the diagnostic requirements for depressive episode have been met continuously for at least the past two years  For a discussion of other aspects of the classification of mood disorders, with the relevant therapeutic implications, as well as for information about the differences between the ICD 11 and the DSM 5 concerning other sections of the classification of mental disorders, we refer the reader to previous

patients' lives  Different approaches are used aiming to improve these scars, including intralesional corticosteroids, surgery and more recently, laser therapy  Since laser therapy is expensive and may have adverse effects, it is critical to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of this therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars  To assess the effects of laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars  In March 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL EBSCO Plus and LILACS  To identify additional studies, we also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta analyses, and health technology reports  There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting  We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for treating hypertrophic or keloid scars (or both), comparing laser therapy with placebo, no intervention or another intervention  Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted the data, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and carried out GRADE assessments to assess the certainty of evidence  A third review author arbitrated if there were disagreements  We included 15 RCTs, involving 604 participants (children and adults) with study sample sizes ranging from 10 to 120 participants (mean 40 27)  Where studies randomised different parts of the same scar, each scar segment was the unit of analysis (906 scar segments)  The length of participant follow up varied from 12 weeks to 12 months  All included trials had a high risk of bias for at least one domain  all studies were deemed at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel  The variability of intervention types, controls, follow up periods and limitations with report data meant we pooled data for one comparison (and only two outcomes within this)  Several review secondary outcomes   cosmesis, tolerance, preference for different modes of treatment, adherence, and change in quality of life   were not reported in any of the included studies  Laser versus no treatment  We found low certainty evidence suggesting there may be more hypertrophic and keloid scar improvement (that is scars are less severe) in 585 nm pulsed dye laser (PDL)  treated scars compared with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1 96  95  confidence interval (CI)  1 11 to 3 45  two studies, 60 scar segments)  It is unclear whether non ablative fractional laser (NAFL) impacts on hypertrophic scar severity when compared with no treatment (very low certainty evidence)  It is unclear whether fractional carbon dioxide (CO sub 2  sub ) laser impacts on hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with no treatment (very low certainty evidence)  Eight studies reported treatment related adverse effects but did not provide enough data for further analyses  Laser versus other treatments  We are uncertain whether treatment with 585 nm PDL impacts on hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with intralesional corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), intralesional Fluorouracil (5 FU) or combined use of TAC plus 5 FU (very low certainty evidence)  It is also uncertain whether erbium laser impacts on hypertrophic scar severity when compared with TAC (very low certainty evidence)  Other comparisons included 585 nm PDL versus silicone gel sheeting, fractional CO sub 2  sub  laser versus TAC and fractional CO sub 2  sub  laser versus verapamil  However, the authors did not report enough data regarding the severity of scars to compare the interventions  As only very low certainty evidence is available on treatment related adverse effects, including pain, charring (skin burning so that the surface becomes blackened), telangiectasia (a condition in which tiny blood vessels cause thread like red lines on the skin), skin atrophy (skin thinning), purpuric discolorations, hypopigmentation (skin colour becomes lighter), and erosion (loss of part of the top layer of skin, leaving a denuded surface) secondary to blistering, we are not able to draw conclusions as to how these treatments compare  Laser plus other treatment versus other treatment  It is unclear whether 585 nm PDL plus TAC plus 5 FU leads to a higher percentage of good to excellent improvement in hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with TAC plus 5 FU, as the certainty of evidence has been assessed as very low  Due to very low certainty evidence, it is also uncertain whether CO sub 2  sub  laser plus TAC impacts on keloid scar severity compared with cryosurgery plus TAC  The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd YAG) laser plus intralesional corticosteroid diprospan plus 5 FU on scar severity compared with diprospan plus 5 FU and about the effect of helium neon (He Ne) laser plus decamethyltetrasiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane and cyclopentasiloxane cream on scar severity compared with decamethyltetrasiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane and cyclopentasiloxane cream  Only very low certainty evidence is available on treatment related adverse effects, including pain, atrophy, erythema, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, regrowth, hyperpigmentation (skin colour becomes darker), and depigmentation (loss of colour from the skin)  Therefore, we are not able to draw conclusions as to how these treatments compare   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS  There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars  The available information is also insufficient to perform a more accurate analysis on treatment related adverse effects related to laser therapy  Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, conflicting results, study design issues and small sample sizes, further high quality trials, with validated scales and core outcome sets should be developed  These trials should take into consideration the consumers' opinion and values, the need for long term follow up and the necessity of reporting the rate of recurrence of scars to determine whether lasers may achieve superior results when compared with other therapies for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars",

Library  2020, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 22 September 2020), and Ovid Embase (1974 to 22 September 2020)  We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ClinicalTrials gov for ongoing trials  We also searched Epistemonikos (to 19 February 2021), LILACS BIREME (to 19 February 2021), and Clarivate Web of Science (to 26 February 2021), and contacted authors and funders of the identified trials to obtain additional information and individual participant data  There were no language restrictions  Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least 12 months' follow up comparing antihypertensive pharmacological therapy (monotherapy or in combination) with placebo or no treatment in adults (18 years of age or older) with hypertension induced LVH were eligible for inclusion  The trials must have analysed at least one primary outcome (all cause mortality, cardiovascular events, or total serious adverse events) to be considered for inclusion  Two review authors screened the search results, with any disagreements resolved by consensus amongst all review authors  Two review authors carried out the data extraction and analyses  We assessed risk of bias of the included studies following Cochrane methodology  We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence  We included three multicentre RCTs  We selected 930 participants from the included studies for the analyses, with a mean follow up of 3 8 years (range 3 5 to 4 3 years)  All of the included trials performed an intention to treat analysis  We obtained evidence for the review by identifying the population of interest from the trials' total samples  None of the trials provided information on the cause of LVH  The intervention varied amongst the included trials  hydrochlorothiazide plus triamterene with the possibility of adding alpha methyldopa, spironolactone, or olmesartan  Placebo was administered to participants in the control arm in two trials, whereas participants in the control arm of the remaining trial did not receive any add on treatment  The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of additional antihypertensive pharmacological therapy compared to placebo or no treatment on mortality (14 3  intervention versus 13 6  control  risk ratio (RR) 1 02, 95  confidence interval (CI) 0 74 to 1 40  3 studies  930 participants  very low certainty evidence)  cardiovascular events (12 6  intervention versus 11 5  control  RR 1 09, 95  CI 0 77 to 1 55  3 studies  930 participants  very low certainty evidence)  and hospitalisation for heart failure (10 7  intervention versus 12 5  control  RR 0 82, 95  CI 0 57 to 1 17  2 studies  915 participants  very low certainty evidence)  Although both arms yielded similar results for total serious adverse events (48 9  intervention versus 48 1  control  RR 1 02, 95  CI 0 89 to 1 16  3 studies  930 participants  very low certainty evidence) and total adverse events (68 3  intervention versus 67 2  control  RR 1 07, 95  CI 0 86 to 1 34  2 studies  915 participants), the incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events may be significantly higher with antihypertensive drug therapy (15 2  intervention versus 4 9  control  RR 3 09, 95  CI 1 69 to 5 66  1 study  522 participants  very low certainty evidence)  Sensitivity analyses limited to blinded trials, trials with low risk of bias in core domains, and trials with no funding from the pharmaceutical industry did not change the results of the main analyses  Limited evidence on the change in left ventricular mass index prevented us from drawing any firm conclusions  We are uncertain about the effects of adding additional antihypertensive drug therapy on the morbidity and mortality of participants with LVH and hypertension compared to placebo  Although the incidence of serious adverse events was similar between study arms, additional antihypertensive therapy may be associated with more withdrawals due to adverse events  Limited and low certainty evidence requires that caution be used when interpreting the findings  High quality clinical trials addressing the effect of antihypertensives on clinically relevant variables and carried out specifically in individuals with hypertension induced LVH are warranted",

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of topical treatment for facial burns were eligible for inclusion in this review  Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence  In this first update, we included 12 RCTs, comprising 507 participants  Most trials included

Estimates), with contributions from a large number of individual experts  Evidence from human, animal and mechanistic data suggests that occupational exposure to dusts and or fibres (silica, asbestos and coal dust) causes pneumoconiosis  In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta analysis of the prevalences and levels of occupational exposure to silica, asbestos and coal dust  These estimates of prevalences and levels will serve as input data for estimating (if feasible) the number of deaths and disability adjusted life years that are attributable to occupational exposure to silica, asbestos and coal dust, for the development of the WHO ILO Joint Estimates  We aimed to systematically review and meta analyse estimates of the prevalences and levels of occupational exposure to silica, asbestos and coal dust among working age (  15 years) workers  We searched electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and CISDOC  We also searched electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites  hand searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews and included study records  and consulted additional experts  We included working age (  15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and or ILO Member State but excluded children (  15 years) and unpaid domestic workers  We included all study types with objective dust or fibre measurements, published between 1960 and 2018, that directly or indirectly reported an estimate of the prevalence and or level of occupational exposure to silica, asbestos and or coal dust  At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, then data were extracted from qualifying studies  We combined prevalence estimates by industrial sector (ISIC 4 2 digit level with additional merging within Mining, Manufacturing and Construction) using random effects meta analysis  Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias and all available authors assessed the quality of evidence, using the ROB SPEO tool and QoE SPEO approach developed specifically for the WHO ILO Joint Estimates  Eighty eight studies (82 cross sectional studies and 6 longitudinal studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising   2 4 million measurements covering 23 countries from all WHO regions (Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, Europe, and Western Pacific)  The target population in all 88 included studies was from major ISCO groups 3 (Technicians and Associate Professionals), 6 (Skilled Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Workers), 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers), 8 (Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers), and 9 (Elementary Occupations), hereafter called manual workers  Most studies were performed in Construction, Manufacturing and Mining  For occupational exposure to silica, 65 studies (61 cross sectional studies and 4 longitudinal studies) were included with   2 3 million measurements collected in 22 countries in all six WHO regions  For occupational exposure to asbestos, 18 studies (17 cross sectional studies and 1 longitudinal) were included with   20,000 measurements collected in eight countries in five WHO regions (no data for Africa)  For occupational exposure to coal dust, eight studies (all cross sectional) were included comprising   100,000 samples in six countries in five WHO regions (no data for Eastern Mediterranean)  Occupational exposure to silica, asbestos and coal dust was assessed with personal or stationary active filter sampling  for silica and asbestos, gravimetric assessment was followed by technical analysis  Risk of bias profiles varied between the bodies of evidence looking at asbestos, silica and coal dust, as well as between industrial sectors  However, risk of bias was generally highest for the domain of selection of participants into the studies  The largest bodies of evidence for silica related to the industrial sectors of Construction (ISIC 41 43), Manufacturing (ISIC 20, 23 25, 27, 31 32) and Mining (ISIC 05, 07, 08)  For Construction, the pooled prevalence estimate was 0 89 (95  CI 0 84 to 0 93, 17 studies, I sup 2  sup  91 , moderate quality of evidence) and the level estimate was rated as of very low quality of evidence  For Manufacturing, the pooled prevalence estimate was 0 85 (95  CI 0 78 to 0 91, 24 studies, I sup 2  sup  100 , moderate quality of evidence) and the pooled level estimate was rated as of very low quality of evidence  The pooled prevalence estimate for Mining was 0 75 (95  CI 0 68 to 0 82, 20 studies, I sup 2  sup  100 , moderate quality of evidence) and the pooled level estimate was 0 04 mg m sup 3  sup  (95  CI 0 03 to 0 05, 17 studies, I sup 2  sup  100 , low quality of evidence)  Smaller bodies of evidence were identified for Crop and animal production (ISIC 01  very low quality of evidence for both prevalence and level)  Professional, scientific and technical activities (ISIC 71, 74  very low quality of evidence for both prevalence and level)  and Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (ISIC 35  very low quality of evidence for both prevalence and level)  For asbestos, the pooled prevalence estimate for Construction (ISIC 41, 43, 45,) was 0 77 (95  CI 0 65 to 0 87, six studies, I sup 2  sup  99 , low quality of evidence) and the level estimate was rated as of very low quality of evidence  For Manufacturing (ISIC 13, 23 24, 29 30), the pooled prevalence and level estimates were rated as being of very low quality of evidence  Smaller bodies of evidence were identified for Other mining and quarrying (ISIC 08  very low quality of evidence for both prevalence and level)  Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (ISIC 35  very low quality of evidence for both prevalence and level)  and Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation (ISIC 37  very low quality of evidence for levels)  For coal dust, the pooled prevalence estimate for Mining of coal and lignite (ISIC 05), was 1 00 (95  CI 1 00 to 1 00, six studies, I sup 2  sup  16 , moderate quality of evidence) and the pooled level estimate was 0 77 mg m sup 3  sup  (95  CI 0

quality of evidence for prevalence, and the pooled level estimate being 0 60 mg m sup 3  sup  (95  CI  6 95 to 8 14, one study, low quality of evidence)  Overall, we judged the bodies of evidence for occupational exposure to silica to vary by industrial sector between very low and moderate quality of evidence for prevalence, and very low and low for level  For occupational exposure to asbestos, the bodies of evidence varied by industrial sector between very low and low quality of evidence for prevalence and were of very low quality of evidence for level  For occupational exposure to coal dust, the bodies of evidence were of very low or moderate quality of evidence for prevalence, and low for level  None of the included studies were population based studies (i e , covered the entire workers' population in the industrial sector), which we judged to present serious concern for indirectness, except for occupational exposure to coal dust within the industrial sector of mining of coal and lignite  Selected estimates of the prevalences and levels of occupational exposure to silica by industrial sector are considered suitable as input data for the WHO ILO Joint Estimates, and selected estimates of the prevalences and levels of occupational exposure to asbestos and coal dust may perhaps also be suitable for estimation purposes  Protocol identifier  https   doi org 10 1016 j

    "pubmed_def": "Otosclerosis is a bone condition affecting the stapes bone within the otic capsule, and its exact cause is still unknown  It is characterized by a lack of proper remodeling of newly formed vascular and woven bone, leading to the development of abnormal osteons and the formation of sclerotic bone  Bilateral otosclerosis is seen in 80  of patients and 60  of otosclerosis patients have a family history of the condition  The etiology of this disease is still unknown, there are lots of theories to explain it  The histopathological (HP) studies of otosclerosis showed that osteoblasts, osteoclasts, vascular proliferation, fibroblasts, and histiocytes were observed in the stapes footplate  The onset of the symptoms occurs by the early third decade of life, usually it doesn't start later  In otosclerosis, the energy exerted by sound at the level of the tympanic membrane is reduced in the inner ear due to the fixation and rigidity of the ossicular chain, leading to hearing loss, especially for low frequencies  The primary clinical symptom of otosclerosis is conductive hearing loss but it is important to note that sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss can also occur as secondary symptoms of the condition  Another symptom present in patients with otosclerosis is tinnitus  The paper carried out a retrospective study of 70 patients diagnosed with otosclerosis in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Emergency City Hospital, Timi oara, Romania, between January 2021 to December 2022  Tissue fragments were processed at Service of Pathology by standard Hematoxylin Eosin staining  The HP diagnosis was completed using Masson's trichrome staining, Giemsa histochemical staining, and immunohistochemical (IHC) reactions with anti cluster of differentiation (CD)20, anti CD3, anti CD4, anti CD8, anti CD34, and anti CD31 antibodies  The microscopic examination showed a chronic diffuse inflammatory infiltrate that consisted predominantly of mature T lymphocytes, immunohistochemically positive for CD3, CD4 and CD8  There were also present rare CD20 positive B lymphocytes  Among the lymphocytes, relatively numerous mast cells were identified, highlighted histochemically by the Giemsa staining  They had numerous purple violet intracytoplasmic granules  In the connective tissue support, a relatively rich vascular network was identified, consisting of hyperemic capillaries, highlighted immunohistochemically with anti CD31 and anti CD34 antibodies  Bone tissues trabeculae showed extensive areas of fibrosis  The collagen fibers were highlighted by Masson's trichrome staining, being stained in green, blue, or bluish green",
