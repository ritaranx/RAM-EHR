Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u03b2 cell receptor.

Fluoxetine is a racemic mixture of the R- and S- enantiomers and are of equivalent pharmacologic activity. Despite distinct structural differences between compounds in this class, SSRIs possess similar pharmacological activity. As with other antidepressant agents, several weeks of therapy may be required before a clinical effect is seen. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of neuronal serotonin reuptake. They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize &alpha;- or &beta;-adrenergic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. During acute use, SSRIs block serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. The overall clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that leads to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and headache. Side effects generally occur within the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants. Fluoxetine may be used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), moderate to severe bulimia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and in combination with olanzapine for treatment-resistant or bipolar I depression.

The nerve fibers of the parasympathetic system are responsible for the involuntary movement of smooth muscles present in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, lungs, sweat glands, and many other parts of the body.In broad terms, anticholinergics are divided into two categories in accordance with their specific targets in the central and peripheral nervous system and at the neuromuscular junction: antimuscarinic agents and antinicotinic agents (ganglionic blockers, neuromuscular blockers).The term \"anticholinergic\" is typically used to refer to antimuscarinics which competitively inhibit the binding of ACh to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; such agents do not antagonize the binding at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, although the term is sometimes used to refer to agents which do so.\n\n\n== Medical uses ==\nAnticholinergic drugs are used to treat a variety of conditions:\n\nDizziness (including vertigo and motion sickness-related symptoms)\nExtrapyramidal symptoms, a potential side-effect of antipsychotic medications\nGastrointestinal disorders (e.g., peptic ulcers, diarrhea, pylorospasm, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, nausea, and vomiting)\nGenitourinary disorders (e.g., cystitis, urethritis, and prostatitis)\nInsomnia, although usually only on a short-term basis\nRespiratory disorders (e.g., asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD])\nSinus bradycardia due to a hypersensitive vagus nerve\nOrganophosphate based nerve agent poisoning, such as VX, sarin, tabun, and soman (atropine is favoured in conjunction with an oxime, usually pralidoxime)Anticholinergics generally have antisialagogue effects (decreasing saliva production), and most produce some level of sedation, both being advantageous in surgical procedures.Until the beginning of the 20th century, anticholinergic drugs were widely used to treat psychiatric disorders.",
    "pubmed_def": "Anticholinergics are medications that block the action of acetylcholine in the central or peripheral nervous system  Medications with anticholinergic properties are commonly prescribed to older adults  The cumulative anticholinergic effect of all the medications a person takes is referred to as the anticholinergic burden  A high anticholinergic burden may cause cognitive impairment in people who are otherwise cognitively healthy, or cause further cognitive decline in people with pre existing cognitive problems  Reducing anticholinergic burden through deprescribing interventions may help to prevent onset of cognitive impairment or slow the rate of cognitive decline  Primary objective   To assess the efficacy and safety of anticholinergic medication reduction interventions for improving cognitive outcomes in cognitively healthy older adults and older adults with pre existing cognitive issues  Secondary Objectives   To compare the effectiveness of different types of reduction interventions (e g  pharmacist led versus general practitioner led, educational versus audit and feedback) for reducing overall anticholinergic burden    To establish optimal duration of anticholinergic reduction interventions, sustainability, and lessons learnt for upscaling   To compare results according to differing anticholinergic scales used in medication reduction intervention trials   To assess the efficacy of anticholinergic medication reduction interventions for improving other clinical outcomes, including mortality, quality of life, clinical global impression, physical function, institutionalisation, falls, cardiovascular diseases, and neurobehavioral outcomes  We searched CENTRAL on 22 December 2022, and we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases from inception to 1 November 2022  We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that aimed to reduce anticholinergic burden in older people and that investigated cognitive outcomes  Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies  The data were not suitable for meta analysis, so we summarised them narratively  We used GRADE methods to rate our confidence in the review results  We included three trials with a total of 299 participants  All three trials were conducted in a cognitively mixed population (some cognitively healthy participants, some participants with dementia)  Outcomes were assessed after one to three months  One trial reported significantly improved performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) in the intervention group (treatment difference 0 70, 95  confidence interval (CI) 0 11 to 1 30), although there was no difference between the groups in the proportion of participants with reduced anticholinergic burden  Two trials successfully reduced anticholinergic burden in the intervention group  Of these, one reported no significant difference between the intervention versus control in terms of their effect on cognitive performance measured by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) immediate recall (mean between group difference 0 54, 95  CI  0 91 to 2 05), CERAD delayed recall (mean between group difference  0 23, 95  CI 0 85 to 0 38), CERAD recognition (mean between group difference 0 77, 95  CI  0 39 to 1 94), and Mini Mental State Examination (mean between group difference 0 39, 95  CI  0 96 to 1 75)  The other trial reported a significant correlation between anticholinergic burden and a test of working memory after the intervention (which suggested reducing the burden improved performance), but reported no effect on multiple other cognitive measures  In GRADE terms, the results were of very low certainty  There were no reported between group differences for any other clinical outcome we investigated  It was not possible to investigate differences according to type of reduction intervention or type of anticholinergic scale, to measure the sustainability of interventions, or to establish lessons learnt for upscaling  No trials investigated safety outcomes  There is insufficient evidence to reach any conclusions on the effects of anticholinergic burden reduction interventions on cognitive outcomes in older adults with or without prior cognitive impairment  The evidence from RCTs was of very low certainty so cannot support or refute the hypothesis that actively reducing or stopping prescription of medications with anticholinergic properties can improve cognitive outcomes in older people  There is no evidence from RCTs that anticholinergic burden reduction interventions improve other clinical outcomes such as mortality, quality of life, clinical global impression, physical function, institutionalisation, falls, cardiovascular diseases, or neurobehavioral outcomes  Larger RCTs investigating long term outcomes are needed  Future RCTs should also investigate potential benefits of anticholinergic reduction interventions in cognitively healthy populations and cognitively impaired populations separately",

    "pubmed_def": "The high proportion of iodine deficiency diseases in the structure of general morbidity determines the relevance of creating new nontoxic iodine containing compounds and improving the processes of iodization of foods of mass consumption  In recent years, to solve this problem, a number of iodine containing compounds based on natural polymers have been proposed, including pectin (iodinepectin), casein (iodine casein), inulin (iodine inulin)  It seems promising to create iodine containing conjugates for food industry not only based on natural polymers, which are not individual compounds, but also based on low molecular plant metabolites that have a high potential for correcting public health  The attention of researchers is attracted, in particular, by the glycosides of Stevia rebaudiana, which have positively proven themselves in the food industry for many years  Current trends in the development of industrial production of iodine fortified products also include requirements for the compatibility of iodine containing concentrates with food industry technologies, especially in the formation of time stable micro heterogeneous aqueous dispersions  In connection with the above,  b the purpose  b  of the research was to confirm the formation of an iodine conjugate with a low molecular weight metabolite of Stevia rebaudiana (glycoside rebaudioside A) by infrared (IR) spectroscopy  and to assess the resistance to sedimentation of its aqueous micro heterogeneous dispersions (iodine glycoside) comparatively with iodine compounds with natural plant polymeric carriers   pectin (iodine pectin) and inulin (iodine inulin) by the method of nanostructural analysis   b Material and methods  b   The IR spectra of the compounds were recorded on a Fourier spectrometer  Measurement of particle sizes in dispersions of iodine containing substances was carried out on a laser analyzer, wave length 375 nm, in a quartz cuvette (7 ml) after 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 24, 72 and 144 h  To prepare dispersions, a weighed portion of iodine pectin (105 mg) was mixed in 100 cm3 of water (600 rpm) at a temperature of 35 40  C for 60 70 min, weighed portions of iodine glycoside (120 mg) and iodine inulin (49 7 mg) were dissolved in 100 cm3 of water at room temperature (23  C) for 3 4 min   b Results  b   An IR spectroscopy study of the interaction of iodine with rebaudioside A indicated the stabilization of molecular iodine by the functional groups of the glycoside, leading to the formation of a stable iodine glycoside conjugate  Assessment of the aqueous dispersions of particles of this conjugate by nanostructural analysis showed that the substance iodine glycoside formed a stable microheterogeneous dispersion with a particle diameter of about 300 nm, which didn't undergo sedimentation during the entire observation period (6 days)  Aqueous dispersions of the iodine inulin with a particle size of  10 nm were comparable with true solutions and remained also stable throughout the entire observation period  Particles of the iodine containing compound iodine pectin formed moderately stable aquatic dispersed systems, the time of complete sedimentation of which was 6 10 h   b Conclusion  b   The study of the IR spectra of rebaudioside A and the synthesized sample iodine glycoside made it possible to confirm the conclusion about the inclusion of iodine molecules in the structure of glycoside molecules  Micro heterogeneous stable dispersions of this conjugate, as well as iodine inulin substances, can be convenient concentrates for enriching milk with iodine  Rapid aggregation of particles of iodine pectin substances in concentrates can prevent their uniform distribution in the target environment, which reduces the effectiveness of industrial technologies for iodine fortified foods for the mass prevention of endemic goiter",
